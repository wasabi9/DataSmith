1. Domain - Specification of the domain in which data generation is to be done.
2. Getting Domain Knowledge - Either provided through documents or gathered by serving the web
3. Task Specification + Example Data Points - Specify Task Type, Description and Provide Data Examples
4. Confounding Variables and Diversity Dimensions - Either manual or to be determined automatically
